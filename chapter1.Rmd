# 1: About the project

The initial setting up of all the necessary tools proved to be a bit of a challenge. R Studio didn't seem to be able to download all the necessary packages for "knitting" the changes. However, after a rather lengthy troubleshooting session and some help everything finally fell into place.

The R excercises in DataCamp were simple enough, so I do hope that the rest of the course will be a breeze in comparison. :D

Here's a link to my [repository](https://github.com/Tulikko/IODS-project)!

Learning R was anyway something that I intended to do. After the course I hope to be able to do at least principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) for our project data without relying on commercial tools.
