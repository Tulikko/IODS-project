Here is the dataset that I wrangled in the previous part of the excercise.

```{r}
date()

# reading the wrangled analysis csv
read.table("data/learning2020.txt")

# assigning the data to something easier to write in codes
lrn2020 <- read.table("data/learning2020.txt")

# dimensions of data: 183 observations and 7 variables
dim(lrn2020)

# structure of data: shows as a table
str(lrn2020)
```
