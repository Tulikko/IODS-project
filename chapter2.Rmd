# RStudio Exercise 2

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

Here is the dataset that I wrangled in the previous part of the excercise. The full table is at the end, but first let's just take a look at what we've got.

```{r}

# assigning the data to something easier to write in codes
lrn2020 <- read.table("data/learning2020.txt")

# dimensions of data: 183 observations and 7 variables
dim(lrn2020)

# structure of data: shows as a table
str(lrn2020)

# reading full analysis csv
read.table("data/learning2020.txt")

date()

```
