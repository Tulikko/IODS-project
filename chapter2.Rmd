# RStudio Exercise 2

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

Here is the dataset that I wrangled in the previous part of the excercise. The full table is at the end, but first let's just take a look at what we've got.

```{r}

# assigning the data to something easier to write in codes
lrn2020 <- read.table("data/learning2020.txt")

# dimensions of data: 183 observations and 7 variables
dim(lrn2020)

# structure of data: str() / gives you structural info and the amount of obs. & variables
str(lrn2020)

# structure of data: head() / I like this a bit more than str() for structural info, easier to read!
head(lrn2020)

# full analysis csv
read.table("data/learning2020.txt")

date()

```
